# Useless dungeon exercise

The purpose of this exercise is to provide students with the opportunity to practice and reinforce the skills they have learned during module 1. In this exercise, you'll create command-line applications that:

* Allows the user to create a hero
* Allows the user to move their hero through a dungeon
* Allows the user to fight monsters
* Never allows the user to win

## Learning objectives

This is a review of the following concepts:

* Command-line programs
* Classes and encapsulation
* Polymorphism
* Managing inheritance

This is also an opportunity to introduce the following concepts:

* Encapsulating IO in a service class
* Instantiating objects using an external class (get ready for instantiation design patterns)
* Using the _Generate Tool_ in IntelliJ to generate constructors, getters and setters
